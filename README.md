# Pranay Solanki

Hi, I'm Pranay Solanki and i'm a **Data and Actuarial Student** from Mumbai, India. I really enjoy the process of creating, testing and deploying models to solve problems of regression and prediction. 

**Skills:**
* **Programming Languages:** R, Python
* **Libraries and Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras, MySQL, SQL Server, Jupyter Notebook, Git
* **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, Ensemble, PCA, ANN, CNN

**Projects:**
* **Digit Recognizer:** Developed a machine learning model using a Sequential Neural Network to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
* **Network Activity Anomaly Detection:** Built a predictive model to identify abnormal network traffic patterns, potentially indicating security threats or network failures. 
* **Vaccine Prediction:** Created a model to predict whether an individual has taken two different vaccines by testing different models and conducting hyper-parameter Tuning.
